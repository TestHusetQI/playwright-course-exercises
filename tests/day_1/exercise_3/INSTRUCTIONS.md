# Day 1 – Exercise 3: Making our first real playwright tests

## Goals:
    - Get a better understanding of the @playwright/test module
    - Create a test that locates input fields and fills them.
    - Use Playwright to locate a button and click it
    - Use assertions (expects) that the outputs shows the correct value

## Exercise 3
    1. Go to the following URL and wait for the page title to load (https://practice.expandtesting.com/inputs)
    2. Create locators for each input field and the two buttons (Display Inputs + Clear Inputs)
    3. Use the fill function to write the correct type into each field (you can skip the date input)
    4. Press the "Display Inputs" button
    5. Assert that each output field has the same value as the input field.
    6. Take a screenshot with the label 'day2_exercise2'
    7. Click on the clear inputs
    8. Then assert that each input field is empty
